Arrays
------

Implement the last_games method below to return the games from the passed index to the end of the list. Try using Array#from to return all games starting from 'Contra'. Also change the call to last_games to pass in the correct index.

```ruby
  def last_games(games, index)

  end
  games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
  puts last_games(games, 0)
```
