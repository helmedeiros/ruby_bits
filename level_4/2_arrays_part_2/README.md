Arrays - Part 2
---------------

We have a last_games method, but we need a first_games method as well. Use Array#to to return the list of games up to Metroid. Also change the call to first_games to take in the correct index.

```ruby
  def first_games(games, index)

  end
  games = ["Super Mario Bros.", "Contra", "Metroid", "Mega Man 2"]
  puts first_games(games, 0)
```
