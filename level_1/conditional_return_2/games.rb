# Conditional Return II
# One of the most common places to use conditional returns is within methods.
# Refactor the code below, removing the search_result variable all together.
def search(games, search_term)
  search_index = games.find_index(search_term)
  search_result = if search_index
    "Game #{search_term} found: #{games[search_index]} at index #{search_index}."
  else
    "Game #{search_term} not found."
  end
  return search_result
