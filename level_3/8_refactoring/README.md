LEVEL 3 - Encapsulation, instance & private methods, inheritance, and refactoring
=================================================================================

Refactoring
-----------

Our to_s method will come in very handy. Whenever we need to output a game, rather than calling a method on the game, we can just output the game object and Ruby will call to_s on it automatically. Refactor both classes below. Change the description method of Game to use the to_s method implicitly. Then remove any duplicated code in ConsoleGame. Note: you'll need to use self inside a class to reference the entire object.

```ruby
class Game
  attr_accessor :name, :year, :system
  attr_reader :created_at
  def initialize(name, options={})
    self.name = name
    self.year = options[:year]
    self.system = options[:system]
    @created_at = Time.now
  end

  def to_s
    self.name
  end

  def description
    "#{self.name} was released in #{self.year}."
  end
end

class ConsoleGame < Game
  def to_s
    "#{self.name} - #{self.system}"
  end

  def description
    "#{self.name} - #{self.system} was released in #{self.year}."
  end
end

```
