LEVEL 2 - Methods and Classes
=============================

Class
---------------------

Passing around hashes is getting troublesome, let's use a class to hold our data. We've started the Game class for you, now please implement the initialize method to store name, system and year in instance variables.

```ruby
class Game
  def initialize(name, options={})
  end
end
```
